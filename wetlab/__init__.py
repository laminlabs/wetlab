"""A `wetlab` schema.

This default wetlab schema module mostly serves to exemplify `how you define
costum registries on GitHub <https://github.com/laminlabs/wetlab/blob/main/wetlab/models.py>`__.

Most professional users create their custom schemas to map their operations or
leverage schema synching from Benchling. If you need help with this, please
`reach out <https://lamin.ai/contact>`__!

Generally, the wetlab schema is designed to model experimental covariates
and perturbations including their targets.

Install the schema module::

   pip install wetlab

Create your instance mounting the module::

   lamin init --storage ./test-wetlab --schema bionty,wetlab

Import in Python::

   import wetlab as wl

Registries:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: .

   Experiment
   ExperimentType
   Biosample
   Techsample
   CombinationTreatment
   GeneticTreatment
   CompoundTreatment
   EnvironmentalTreatment
   TreatmentTarget
